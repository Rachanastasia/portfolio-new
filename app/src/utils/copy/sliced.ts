  'Sliced is a project that Rachel has been iterating on for years. since she at the beginning of the pandemic when I was cooking for 2 and making do with what I had in the kitchen most days. To convert recipes to the lowest common denominator of what I had on-hand, I kept asking Siri whats half of 1/3 cups in tablespoons . Since these calculations are more quickly done by a computer, I created Sliced to scale down amounts and units, and provide a visual reference of the new ingredients.'
